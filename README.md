# React Soccer

This is a very simple app using [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that I've written so that I could learn more about the platform. It uses the [Futebits API](http://www.futebits.com.br/) to grab match data (past and upcoming) for the current (or last, in the case of past leagues) round in popular Brazilian soccer leagues.

To follow the API convention, some of the variables and methods are named in Portuguese. All text in the app itself is also in Portuguese.

## Running the app

- Install [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and its dependencies
- `git clone https://github.com/fabiorodella/ReactSoccer.git`
- `cd ReactSoccer && npm install`
- `open ReactSoccer.xcodeproj`
- Build and run

Or run online in the [React Native Playground](https://rnplay.org/apps/RXoNBg).
